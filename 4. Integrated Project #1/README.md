# Integrated Project #1


<strong> Project description: </strong>

<p> You work for the online store Ice, which sells videogames all over the world.
 User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available
 from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not.
 This allows you to put your money on a potentially hot new item and plan advertising campaigns.
In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and you’re planning a campaign for 2017.</p>
