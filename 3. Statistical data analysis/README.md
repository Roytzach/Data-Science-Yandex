# Statistical data analysis - Project


<strong> Project description: </strong>
<p> You work as an analyst for "Megaline", 
a state mobile operator. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans,
 Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department would like to know which of 
 the plans is more profitable in order to adjust the advertising budget.
You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a 
relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 "Megaline" 
clients, specifically, who the clients are, where they are from, which pla
n they use, the number of calls made and SMS they sent in 2018. You have to
 analyse clients' behavior and work out the most profitable prepaid plan.</p>
